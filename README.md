**AI Engineer | Systems Architect | Founder at [Hexel Studio](https://hexelstudio.com)**
**Focus:** Agentic AI · LLM Orchestration · RAG · Multi-Agent Systems

I’m an AI/ML engineer and systems architect focused on building **agentic intelligence infrastructure** — scalable systems where AI agents can reason, coordinate, and act autonomously. My work combines **LLM orchestration**, **distributed architecture**, and **systems engineering** to make intelligent agents reliable and production-ready.

## Core Engineering Focus

* **Agent Systems:** Orchestration, coordination, and secure multi-agent communication
* **LLM Infrastructure:** Context management, reasoning layers, and fine-tuned model pipelines
* **Knowledge Systems:** Retrieval-augmented generation, vector-based memory, and contextual awareness
* **Systems Engineering:** Async microservices, caching, event-driven architecture, and API reliability

---

## Technical Stack

**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, SQL
**Frameworks:** FastAPI, LangChain, Next.js
**Infra & Tools:** Docker, Redis, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, Transformers, OpenAI SDK, Bedrock

## Engineering Philosophy

I approach AI as a **systems problem**, not a model problem. The next leap in intelligence will come from **orchestration, autonomy, and secure system design**, not just larger models. My focus is on building the foundation that makes those systems possible — stable, composable, and intelligent.
