# Khushwant Sanwalot

**AI/ML Engineer | Agentic AI Researcher | Open Source Advocate**

Welcome — I’m Khushwant Sanwalot, an AI/ML engineer and founder of [Hexel Studio](https://github.com/hexelstudio), where I architect intelligent systems that scale. My focus lies at the intersection of Agentic AI, model optimization, and real-world deployment. I build, break, and improve systems that push the boundaries of what intelligent agents can do autonomously.

## 🔬 About Me

* **Research Focus:**
  Agentic AI • Multimodal Systems • Deep Learning • Neural Net Optimization (CUDA/Triton) • Computer Vision • LLMOps

* **Core Tech Stack:**
  Python • PyTorch • FastAPI • Next.js • LangChain • Docker • Kubernetes • GCP • AWS • Azure
  *(Cloud is just compute. It’s all the same under the hood.)*

## ⚡ What Drives Me

I’m obsessed with making AI more autonomous, useful, and efficient. Whether it’s through optimizing low-level compute with Triton or designing high-level reasoning in agentic systems, I aim to build frameworks that reduce friction between research and deployment. I believe the next leap in AI won’t come from bigger models—but from smarter coordination, memory, and action.
