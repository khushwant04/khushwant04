## About Me

I’m **Khushwant Sanwalot**, an AI Engineer and Systems Architect focused on building **agentic intelligence infrastructure** — systems where AI agents can reason, coordinate, and act autonomously.  
My work bridges **AI research and production**, developing scalable orchestration layers, memory systems, and contextual reasoning frameworks.

At **[Hexel Studio](https://hexelstudio.com)**, I lead architecture and backend systems for **Enterprise AI Agents**, focusing on scalability, security, and orchestration efficiency.

## Core Engineering Focus

- **Agent Systems:** Multi-agent orchestration, coordination, and secure communication  
- **LLM Infrastructure:** Context management, reasoning layers, and adaptive prompt pipelines  
- **Knowledge Systems:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector-based memory, contextual retrieval  
- **Systems Engineering:** Async microservices, event-driven architectures, caching, and distributed execution  

---

## Technical Stack

- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, SQL  
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, LangChain, Next.js  
- **Infrastructure & Tools:** Docker, Redis, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes  
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, Transformers, OpenAI SDK, Bedrock  
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Cloud-Native Architectures

## Engineering Philosophy

I treat agents as **autonomous systems**, not chat interfaces.  
The next generation of AI will come from **system-level intelligence** — orchestration, coordination, and adaptive reasoning — not just bigger models.  
My focus is on building **secure, modular, and scalable agentic infrastructure** that enables real-world autonomy.
