# Khushwant Sanwalot

**AI/ML Engineer | Agentic AI Researcher | Open Source Advocate**

Welcome — I’m Khushwant Sanwalot, an AI/ML engineer and founder of [Hexel Studio](https://github.com/hexelstudio), where I architect intelligent systems that scale. My focus lies at the intersection of Agentic AI, model optimization, and real-world deployment. I build, break, and improve systems that push the boundaries of what intelligent agents can do autonomously.

## 🔬 About Me

* **Research Focus:**
  Agentic AI • Multimodal Systems • Deep Learning • Neural Net Optimization (CUDA/Triton) • Computer Vision • LLMOps

* **Core Tech Stack:**
  Python • PyTorch • FastAPI • Next.js • LangChain • Docker • Kubernetes • GCP • AWS • Azure
  *(Cloud is just compute. It’s all the same under the hood.)*

* **Current Work:**

  * 🚀 Building a PyTorch + FastAPI training interface for rapid model iteration
  * 🧠 Engineering generative agents for autonomous data annotation pipelines
  * 🎥 Creating a modular video/image annotation and data curation engine
  * 🤖 Developing LangChain + RAG-based agents with real-time internet access & memory
